# React app

## Setting Up the Development Environment 

You need node version 16 or higher.

Check the node version in a terminal:

```shell
node -v
```

## Creating a React App

You can do it with :

- create-react-app (CRA)
- Vite

We're going to use vite in the terminal:

```shell
npm create vite@latest
```

But here we're going to use a particular version of vite:

```shell
npm create vite@4.1.0
```

Hit "y" and enter, there is a default title for the project but you can change it:
